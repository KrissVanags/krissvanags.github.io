Little Wings was an interactive picture book for children on iOS and Android.
I was the programmer for the project, completing work with one artist.
The book was a story with elements on each page that could be tapped to trigger specific animations.
One of the primary features was to allow the recording of voice tracks on the device to be played back instead of the built in recorded tracks.
This would allow parents to in essence read the book to the child when they were not present.
