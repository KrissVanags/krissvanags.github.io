Buy Somewhere was the product for the last company I was working at.
It provided a pokemon go style experience with being able to purchase property and having custom buildings instead of a flat map.
I was brought in as a Frontend Developer to help with the gameplay and system design of the product.
My main focus was on developing the user experience and gameplay elements along with assisiting in building the art pipeline and proccedural generation.
